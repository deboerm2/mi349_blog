            <h2>Why Bloodborne is Great</h2>
            <p><img src="BloodborneImage.jpg" alt="Image of Bloodborne" width="250"></p>
            <p>	Bloodborne is a 2015 video game created by <em>From Software</em>. Bloodborne is a<br>
                notoriously difficult game for its very punishing combat system. What makes Bloodborne<br>
                different from it’s cousin Dark Souls, is that Bloodborne has much faster gameplay revolving<br>
                around dodging and presents a challenge of managing limited resources during a fight to be successful.
            </p>
                <p>Bloodborne is set in a fictional world where many people have been mutated into a<br>
                    variety of horrifying creatures and some have simply gone mad. Many elements of Bloodborne<br>
                    are inspired by gothic horror with a bit of lovecraft mixed in. These elements are combined with<br>
                    other aspects of the game to make sure the player feels on edge at all times. My particular<br>
                    favorite detail of level design is the choice to have no background music at all. This lack of<br>
                    music leaves the player only able to hear their footsteps as they quietly explore unknown parts<br>
                    of the world. Having no music causes the player to be a lot more tense as they tend to want to<br>
                    anticipate when an enemy might appear as enemies jumping out in surprise is quite common and often<br>
                    very dangerous in such a punishing game in terms of damage.
                </p>
                <p>Bloodborne’s ability to manipulate the player’s fear simply through design choices along<br>
                    with excellent boss fights is what personally makes Bloodborne great.

            <h2>The Art of the Hat</h2>
            <p>Team Fortress 2 is a free-to-play hat simulator with first person shooting mechanics. A<br>
                major part of the game is obtaining cosmetic items to customize and level up your mercenary of<br>
                choice. Despite popular belief, in Team Fortress 2 there is a hidden feature where having better<br>
                cosmetics directly translates into the skill of the player. This feature led to the development of a<br>
                social hierarchy where the players who paid for cosmetics receive extra benefits and the ‘free to<br>
                plays’ who did not are left to fend for themselves. By having more expensive cosmetics, your<br>
                teammates recognize your overflowing skill level at the game and work to support your efforts<br>
                the best they can. This phenomenon is believed to be caused by the free to play players' innate<br>
                desire to find and support someone in a higher tier of the cosmetic hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
               The exact boundaries of the hierarchical tiers are a subject of debate, however one<br>
                definite indicator of high class is the ‘unusual’, a hat with a cool effect. The wielder of an unusual<br>
                is often quickly identified by free to plays due to the effect and immediately supported. Should<br>
                there be two holders of an unusual, the free to plays will be split and there is a possibility that<br>
                they will fight among themselves on which unusual is superior.
            </p>
