        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Florida on July 11, 2001. I have lived in two other states beside<br>
            Florida and those are Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I have spent the most time in<br>
            Florida as I moved back in between Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and lived in Florida<br>
            until I came to MSU.
        </p>
        <p>Until about two years ago, I had played the French Horn since learning it in the fourth <br>
            grade. I ultimately decided to drop the instrument as I had no plans to play in college<br>
             and did not own the instrument myself as I had been renting it.
